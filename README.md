# Master's Project Scripts

## Overview
This repository is a collection of R, python, and linux scripts detailing microbial diversity across three countries. Each script is highly commented, so observe the first few lines of each script for a detailed description of what it accomplishes. **meta_analyze.R** is the primary script for analyses.

## Techniques
These scripts use a combination of machine learning, and bioinformatics techniques including Principal Components Analysis, K-means, logisitic regression, PERMANOVA, and extensive visualizations to describe the genetic diversity of microbes residing on amphibians' skin.
